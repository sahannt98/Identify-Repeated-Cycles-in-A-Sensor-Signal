# Identify-Repeated-Cycles-in-A-Sensor-Signal
This MATLAB code is implemented to identify repeatd cycles in a sensor signals. This code will identify repeated cycles in a bit noisy signal from a sensor and draw vertical lines between cycles in output signal to find repeated cycles easily. ![Input_signal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78171983/142427312-bbeb611a-3956-4c30-8d71-b5f51994d511.jpg)
